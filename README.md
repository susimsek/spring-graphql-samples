# Graphql

GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes
giving clients exactly the data they request and no more.
GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.
It can even be deployed within an integrated development environment (IDE) known as GraphiQL.
As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a
single API call.
